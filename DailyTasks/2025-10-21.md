# Daily Tasks – 2025-10-21

Status tracking for pending items implemented today.

## Context
- Frontend scaffolding complete (Vite, Tailwind v4, Apollo, routing).
- Backend REST auth exists; GraphQL mounted with health field; CORS defaults aligned to 5173/5174.
- Alembic initial migration present; models/services largely scaffolded.

## Plan for Today
- Focus on enabling GraphQL baseline, aligning CORS/env, and prepping dependencies.
- Keep changes minimal and aligned with workspace rules.

## Checklist
- [x] Update backend CORS defaults to include http://localhost:5173 and http://localhost:5174
- [x] Implement minimal GraphQL schema and mount /graphql (Strawberry)
- [x] Add missing dependencies to backend requirements: strawberry-graphql, pydantic-settings
- [x] Update backend/.env.example to document/update allowed origins for dev
- [x] Verify frontend .env example VITE_API_URL alignment (http://localhost:8000)
- [x] Implement Dashboard GraphQL health check with loading/error states
- [ ] Note follow-ups for CSRF + cookie-based auth flow alignment
- [ ] Prepare next tasks for entries/groups GraphQL and UI states

## Notes
- Added health field (Query.health) and verified connectivity from the frontend Dashboard via Apollo client.
- CORS must allow credentials for dev and include exact Vite origins.
- Dependencies must be updated so local dev can install and run the GraphQL server.

## Server checks
- [x] Start backend server (uvicorn on http://localhost:8000)
- [x] Verify GraphQL health returns "ok"
- [x] Start frontend server (Vite on http://localhost:5173)
- [x] Verify frontend root responds HTTP 200

## Verification outputs
- GraphQL: POST /graphql { health } -> {"data": {"health": "ok"}}
- Frontend: GET / -> 200 OK at http://localhost:5173/

## Git
- Branch: main
- Commit: 3eaffba feat(graphql): mount Strawberry /graphql and add health + entries_today; align CORS; FE health check
- Pushed to: origin/main
